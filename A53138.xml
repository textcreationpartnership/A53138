            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>NEWS FROM GUILD-HALL, Or the Combate of the <hi>Gyants.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SO many Improbable Stories have been writ of <hi>Gyants</hi> in former Ages, that this will ſeem rather a Romance, then a Combat, let it be never ſo Real. And though it be Prodigious in it ſelf, yet ſince there are leſs Abſurdities and fewer Contradictions in it, then in ſome Dying Speeches, I know not why I ſhould not be believed as well as any <hi>Father Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi> or <hi>Hungary,</hi> eſpecially having almoſt all the Eyes and Ears of this Incredulous Town, Witneſſes to the <hi>Combat,</hi> to teſtify the Truth of this Relation.</p>
            <p>On the laſt Day, the Debate was held about the Addreſs for Surrendering the Charter, there was ſuch a Noiſe in the Hall as has not been heard, ſince the laſt Memorable Riot. Alace for the poor Charter ſays one, alace for our Freedoms and Lives, ſays another, Liberty and Property, is no more when we ceaſe to be Free-men, we muſt part, we will not part with our Charter. This Acclamation of the Maſters Alarm'd the Maſter-Prentice, who cry'd a Fart for the Charter, let 'em take it, and much good do 'em, ſhall we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain for being Free-men? Now we may Drink, Swear and Whore, as well as Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> himſelf, and Commit Treſpaſs with our Neighbour <hi>Pul<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>en</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the forfeit of our Indentures. A <hi>Butchers</hi> Wife Swore, while ſhe was in the Fleſh, ſhe would Trade in the Fleſh, and diſpoſe of her on in deſpight of the Charter, to whom a <hi>Fiſh-Mongers</hi> Wife made Anſwer, Right Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Charter or no Charter, I will not beat a Farthing of my old Rate ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Fiſh or Fleſh, to the beſt Cuſtomer in <hi>England,</hi> God Bleſs His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. Our own is our own ſtill, and we will uſe them to our beſt advantage.</p>
            <p>In this Fury and Diſtraction they Ran about the Streets all the Day and Night, till about two a Clock in the Morning, when Expecting all things to be at Reſt, but the Watch, and Midnight Goblings; there was ſuch a Noiſe in <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> as Frighted all the Neighbor-hood, Watch and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables, for your muſt Underſtand, the two Gardian <hi>Giants</hi> (alarum'd at the former Crys, or Inſpir'd by the Genius of their different Partys,) were got together by the Ears; at every Stroak that was made the Houſe Shook as with an Earth-quake. All the Glaſs Windows round about were Shiver'd to Pieces, and ſeveral Chimneys were blown down.</p>
            <p>This dreadful Combat of the <hi>Giants</hi> was occaſioned on a difference about the Surrender of the Charter, <hi>Roymond,</hi> the Tory <hi>Giant</hi> Aſſerting and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Kings Rights, and <hi>Routal,</hi> the Right and Liberty of the People, which with the Dreadful threatning and Claſhing on either ſide, made ſuch an horrible Din and Clutter, as had not been heard ſince the laſt Election of Whig <hi>Shrieves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conſtable and Watch finding their Bills too weak to withſtand the <hi>Giants</hi> Clubs, went to the Exchange to Reinforce their party with New <hi>Auxilliaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Battel continued with great Vigour on both ſides. <hi>Roymond</hi> ſtood on his St. <hi>George</hi>'s Guard, being rather willing to Defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then Deſtroy the other, while <hi>Routal</hi>

            <p>No Proud <hi>Roymond,</hi> I Scorn to Submit, tho' to my Maſter, the <hi>Turk</hi> ſhall Submit to the Emperour, and the Rebels in <hi>Hungary</hi> to their Native Soveraign, ſooner then I vvill Submit on theſe Terms. My Life I ſcorn to owe to him that has taken that from me, which is Dearer then that my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, you offer me my Sword, and tye up my Hands from acting. Il'e have all or none.</p>
            <p>Ungrateful Wretch ſaid <hi>Roymond,</hi> is thy Sword with thy Life in my Hand, and does thou refuſe my Favour, prepare thee then for the laſt Stroak, Thus thy proud Head ſhall go to the Ground.</p>
            <p>Quarter, Quarter, Noble <hi>Roymond,</hi> ſaid <hi>Routal,</hi> now I find I am really Conquer'd, I muſt Submit, ſpare me till I make my Will; a few laſt words, and that's all. No time for Canting Speeches now, ſaid <hi>Roymond,</hi> thoul't lye at the laſt Minute. But I give thee time to Name thy Truſtees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Routal. Jenks, Jekel</hi> and <hi>Hubland,</hi> I make my Executors, to receive all my Debts to be Diſtributed for carrying on the Cauſe, and to revenge my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood, and all my Arrears in the Hall to Purchas a New Charter. To <hi>Hinton,</hi> I leave all my Bills and Money at <hi>Cent per Cent,</hi> to break for me, when I am gone, and Compone for 12. Pence in the Pound, to make a Penſion for <hi>Perkin, Armſtrong</hi> and <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> and the Intereſt to <hi>Hubland</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> (ſince Conventicles are going down) to Build a Synagogue for the Saints.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Pa— A.</hi> and <hi>Du—</hi> I leave my Dominion in <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> to ſtand there in my place, as the chief and perpetual Supporters of his Body Uncorporat. To Sir <hi>Thomas P—</hi> I leave all the Reverſion of my Stock in the Chamber of <hi>London</hi> if he has yet any left unſpent, to keep up his Reputation amongſt the Whores, and Act the <hi>Tory</hi> in his Cups till the Whig comes again into Play. To <hi>Cor—</hi> I'le bequeath my Thraſhing Pole with the ball and Iron Spikes inſtead of a Proteſtant Flayl and to Sir <hi>Ro.

To <hi>Beth—</hi> being as Signal for Hoſpitality as Loyalty, I leave a bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nine Pence to entertain the Corporations, and Free-Men on the next E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Whig Sheriffs. To <hi>Cor</hi> I leave Five Groats to write my Elegie, and as many more to <hi>Curtis</hi> for Printing it, to be paid out of the Penſions for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Cauſe, if there be any Remaining, and to Doctor <hi>B—</hi> Four-Score Guennies of the ſame to Write my Speech, which will Serve as well after as before my Execution.</p>
